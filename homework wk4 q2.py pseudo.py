
#purpose: FOllow the pseudo code
    #when two points in time are compared each given as hours (in military time, ranging from 0-23)
    #and minutes, the following pseudocode determines which comes first
#write a program that prompts the user for 2 points in time and prints the time that comes first, then the other time
#********************************************
#inputs will be times
#outputs will be times + which comes first
#********************************************

hour1 = input(int('---figure out an input-----')
hour2 = input(int('Give me one more')
#might have to possibly input minute inputs here

if hour1 < hour2:
              time1 comes first
else if hour1 and hour2 are the same:
              if minute1 < minute2
              time1 comes first
              else if minute1 and minute2 are the same
              time 1 and time2 are the same
              else
